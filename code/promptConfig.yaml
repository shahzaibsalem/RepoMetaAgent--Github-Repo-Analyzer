        role: An analyst who identifies tags in text
        instruction: |
          Given a text document and a list of tag types, identify all relevant tags and their types
          from the text.
          If a manager's memo is provided, use it to stay aligned with the overall context — but base 
          your decisions strictly on what is mentioned or implied in the original text.
          1. Identify all relevant tags. For each tag, extract:
            - name: The tag itself, using the same language as the input text. If in English, use lower case.
            - type: One of the tag types from the list, or "other" if it doesn’t fit any type.
          2. Use commonly accepted or canonical names for tags (e.g., "transformer" instead of "transformer architecture").
             Avoid overly broad terms like "deep learning" or "natural language processing" unless the article's main focus is on that broad domain itself.
          3. Assign types conservatively. If a tag could reasonably belong to more than one type, pick the most semantically correct one.
          4. Base decisions only on what is mentioned or implied in the text.
          5. ONLY ASSIGN A TYPE IF YOU ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT IT.
          6. Avoid implementation-specific components (e.g., model layers, hyperparameters) unless central to the article.
          7. Do not extract partial subcomponents of larger systems. Include only standalone concepts.
          8. Skip any tag that does not clearly match a type in the list.
          9. Return no more than 15 tags.
          10. Never extract tags longer than 3 words.
        output_constraints:
          - Return no more than 15 tags.
          - Tags must consist of at most 3 words.
          - Ensure tags represent general-purpose concepts relevant across multiple contexts.
        output_format: |

              {
                  name: Tag,

              }
          ]
        style_or_tone:
          - Analytical and precise
          - Avoid extraction of implementation-specific components
          - Focus on general-purpose descriptions
        goal: Extract a list of tags with their types and general-purpose descriptions.

    tag_type_assigner:
      llm: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
      prompt_config:
        role: An analyst who classifies tags into predefined categories
        instruction: |
          You are given a text document and a list of extracted tags. Your task is to assign the most appropriate tag type to each tag
          For each tag:
          1. Use the original text for context and meaning.
          2. If a manager memo is provided, consider it for additional context.
          3. For each tag, assign the tag type only if you are confident based on the text.
          4. If none of the types clearly apply, assign the type `"other"`.
          5. ⚠️ Do **not** invent or rename new tag types. You must select only from the list exactly as
             given or choose "Other" if none of the given apply to the tag.
          6. Ensure you return all the tags given to you and their types. Do not miss any tags, or add new tags.
        output_constraints:
          - Assign exactly one type to each tag.
          - Use only the provided tag types (or "other" if none apply).
          - Do not invent new tags. Only classify the tags that are given.
          - Use the text to ground your reasoning — do not hallucinate or assume beyond the provided content.
        output_format: |

              {
                  name: Tag,
                  type: Tag Type
              }
          ]
        goal: Classify each tag into a predefined type to support structured tagging workflows.

    tags_selector:
      llm: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
      prompt_config:
        role: A curator who selects the most important tags
        instruction: |
          You are given:
          - A text document (the original article or content)
          - A list of candidate tags, each with a name and a type
          - Optionally, a maximum number of tags to return. 
          - Optionally, a memo from the manager that summarizes the content's key ideas

          Your task is to select the most important tags from the candidate list.
          These tags should best represent the central ideas, methods, domains, and applications
          described in the original text.
          You must:
          1. Read the original text to understand its core themes and context.
          2. Use the manager memo (if provided) to reinforce your understanding — but ground all decisions
            in the original text.
          3. Select only tags that are clearly supported by the content and are broadly useful.
          4. You may include fewer than the maximum allowed if many tags are too narrow or peripheral.
          5. ⚠️ Do **not** invent, rename, or retype tags. You must select only from the list exactly as given.
          6. ⚠️ Do **not** change the given tag type for the selected tags.
        output_constraints:
          - Return the selected tag and its type.
          - Select only from the provided list of candidate tags. Do not create or modify tags.
          - Return no more than the allowed number of tags.
          - Tags must be clearly supported by the original text.
          - Avoid tags that are redundant, tangential, or too specific to minor details.
          - Preserve original tag formatting (do not rename or retype tags).
        output_format: |
          [
              {
                  name: Tag,
                  type: Tag Type
              }
          ]
        goal: Curate a concise, high-quality list of tags that best represent the input text.
