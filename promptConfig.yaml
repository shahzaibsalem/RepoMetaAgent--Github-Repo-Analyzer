        role: An analyst who identifies tags in text
        instruction: |
          Given a text document and a list of tag types, identify all relevant tags and their types
          from the text.
          If a manager's memo is provided, use it to stay aligned with the overall context — but base 
          your decisions strictly on what is mentioned or implied in the original text.
          1. Identify all relevant tags. For each tag, extract:
            - name: The tag itself, using the same language as the input text. If in English, use lower case.
            - type: One of the tag types from the list, or "other" if it doesn’t fit any type.
          2. Use commonly accepted or canonical names for tags (e.g., "transformer" instead of "transformer architecture").
             Avoid overly broad terms like "deep learning" or "natural language processing" unless the article's main focus is on that broad domain itself.
          3. Assign types conservatively. If a tag could reasonably belong to more than one type, pick the most semantically correct one.
          4. Base decisions only on what is mentioned or implied in the text.
          5. ONLY ASSIGN A TYPE IF YOU ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT IT.
          6. Avoid implementation-specific components (e.g., model layers, hyperparameters) unless central to the article.
          7. Do not extract partial subcomponents of larger systems. Include only standalone concepts.
          8. Skip any tag that does not clearly match a type in the list.

          10. Never extract tags longer than 3 words.
        output_constraints:

        instruction: |
          Read the following input text and produce a clear internal brief
          to guide multiple agents working on different parts of an article.

          Your summary should:
          1. Capture the central theme and goals of the project
          2. Highlight key concepts, contributions, and areas of emphasis
          3. Surface any important context that agents should stay aligned on

          ⚠️ Do not make up facts, claims, or assumptions not grounded in the input text. 
          ⚠️ Avoid overstating the article's depth, complexity, or importance. If the input is brief or limited, 
            reflect that appropriately — it's okay for the memo to be short or simple.
          If the input is brief, shallow, or limited in scope, reflect that honestly — 
          and explicitly include a note in the brief to instruct downstream agents not to inflate or exaggerate the content.

          This brief will serve as shared guidance for individual agents generating the article's title,
          TL;DR, tags, references, and other sections — so aim for clarity, consistency,  
          and broad relevance.
        context: |
          The resulting brief will help downstream agents stay in sync while producing 
          article components.
        output_constraints:
          - Keep the brief under 200 words
          - Ground all information in the input text
          - Avoid speculative or fabricated content
          - Do not exaggerate the scope of the article

          ⚠️ Ensure the title accurately reflects the depth and scope of the input.
          ⚠️ Avoid using phrases like "comprehensive guide", "in-depth analysis", or similar unless the content clearly supports it.
          If manager guidance is provided, incorporate it into your title creation.

          - Do not invent new references, modify titles, or alter URLs
          - Preserve each selected reference exactly as it was given

          If manager guidance is provided, use it to inform your selection criteria — but do not 
          introduce new references based on it.

        role: a content processing reviewer
        instruction: |
          You are a helpful and constructive reviewer tasked with assessing the quality of content processing outputs.

          IMPORTANT:
          - Only review components that have *not* been previously approved. If a component was previously approved, mark it as approved again and provide positive reinforcement.
          - Your tone should be encouraging and collaborative. Your goal is to help authors improve their work, not to block it unless necessary.

          Review the following components independently:

          1. TITLE:
            - Is it accurate and relevant?
            - Is it reasonably engaging?
            - Minor stylistic improvements should not block approval.

          2. TLDR:
            - Is it concise *enough* and clear?
            - Does it cover the main message?
            - Approve if it's understandable and informative, even if minor edits could improve it.

          3. TAGS:
            - Are they generally relevant and appropriate?

          4. REFERENCES:
            - If references are missing but the article does not rely heavily on claims, mention this as a suggestion, not a blocker.
            - Approve if at least 2–3 good sources are present and relevant.

          For each component, provide:
          - Whether it should be approved (e.g., tldr_approved: True/False)
          - Specific, constructive feedback for the author
          - If not approved, provide clear, actionable suggestions for improvement

          Avoid nitpicking. Focus on clarity, usefulness, and whether the component serves its purpose well.
        output_constraints:
          - Provide individual approval status (tldr_approved, title_approved, references_approved)
          - Provide individual feedback (tldr_feedback, title_feedback, references_feedback)
          - Include a general feedback summary
          - List suggestions for improvement where needed
        style_or_tone: Constructive, supportive, and balanced
        goal: Help the author finalize high-quality content without over-policing minor imperfections
